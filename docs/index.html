      <h3>My Experience</h3>
    </p>
    <p>
     Growing up with rescue dogs, I spent much of my early years working with and training my two German Shepard Dogs both of whom had reactivity issues. My family's first dog, Guiness, was very fearful of people and our secong, Harley, is reactive with other dogs. Both dogs presented their own unique challenges, but made great progress with my training. Since then I have worked with a variety of bird species, from crows and vultures to a number of different hawks and owl, working on cooperative care training, glove work, and displaying natural behaviors for audiences. I have also worked with a variety of reptiles, primarily, turtles and non-venomous snakes, but also some venomous snakes on cooperative care, target training, and low stress handling.
